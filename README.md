#Ledjer
To get started, clone it, then create your own branch with a unique name.

```

git checkout -b <your username>
```

## Requirements
Make sure you have the follwoing installed:
  * at least Java 7
  * Maven 3 http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
  * Eclipse IDE for Java Developers - Luna

To test that you have the requirements installed and configured correctly, make sure you get the following outputs:

Java:
$ java -version
java version "1.7.0_45"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)

Maven:
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.2.3 (33f8c3e1027c3ddde99d3cdebad2656a31e8fdf4; 2014-08-11T21:58:10+01:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.2.3/libexec
Java version: 1.7.0_45, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_45.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: US-ASCII
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.9.5", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"

The versions on your system should differ only in their _minor version_ (that's the last number, i.e., 0_45 for Java above).


## Importing ledjer into Eclipse
When you open Eclipse for the first time it will ask you where to place its "workspace".
This is only relevant when creating new projects from within Eclipse.
For this excercise its precise location is not critical, so simply accept Eclipse's default.

To import ledjer into Eclipse:
File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Project
In the input field for the _Root Directory_ navigate to the ledjer folder.
Then proceed to select the pom.xml file in _Projects:_ box.
Hit _Finish_ as the last step.

## Build and run tests using Eclipse
To run all the tests, right-click on the top-level _ledjer_ folder and click _Run as_ and then _JUnit test_.
That will recompile the classes and, assuming there are no compile errors, run the JUnit tests.
